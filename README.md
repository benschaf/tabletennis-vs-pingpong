# [TABLETENNIS VS PINGPONG](https://benschaf.github.io/tabletennis-vs-pingpong)

Do you finally want to settle the difference between ‚ÄúTable Tennis‚Äù and ‚ÄúPing Pong‚Äù? Have you never heard of the sport ‚ÄúClickball‚Äù before? Then this website is perfect for you!

![iamresponsive mockup image](documentation/images/mockup.png)

This repository provides an engaging and informative platform that explores the history, differences, and fun facts about the terms Ping Pong, Table Tennis and Clickball. It includes five sections, covering the general differences of Ping Pong and Table Tennis, a visual representation of the key events and milestones in the history of Ping Pong and Table Tennis, an interesting collection of quotes on the topic, a subscription-based service that provides users with regular updates and insights about the world of Ping Pong and Table Tennis (Disclaimer: The subscription feature is still in development) and a media gallery.

## UX
The UX planning process was separated into three phases:
1. **Collecting inspiration:** Design ideas for the project were taken from the following two websites: store.google.com and youtube.com. The resulting design for this website is kept clean and simple.
2. **Creating User Stories, Wireframes and Mockups:** These were prepared in order to create a better vision of the final project. These drafts were then tailored to provide a relevant and meaningufl exprecience to the user.
3. **Collecting feedback early on:** My Mentor and the great Community of Code Institute were essential in ironing out UX considerations that I hadn't considered.

UX research practices werent in the scope of this project.

### Colour Scheme
The Colour Scheme for this Project was extracted from it's [hero image](#tabletennis-vs-pingpong). The blue tones work nicely together with most Table Tennis related Pictures because of the blue color of official Table Tennis tables.

- `#FFFFFF` used for white background
- `#F3F3F3` used for light background
- `#DDDDDD` used for secondary light background
- `#2B2B34` used for dark background
- `#55C2DA` used for primary highlights
- `#28798B` used for secondary hightlights
- `#000000` used for primary text
- `#FFFFFF` used for secondary text

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/2b2b34-f3f3f3-151526-000000-55c2da) to generate my colour palette.

![Colour Scheme from coolours](documentation/images/colour_scheme_pp1.png)

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
    :root {
        /* p = Primary / s = Secondary */
        --white-backgorund: #fff;
        --light-background: #F3F3F3;
        --s-light-background: #ddd;
        --dark-backgrond: #2B2B34;
        --p-highlight: #55C2DA;
        --s-highlight: #28798B;
        --p-text: #000;
        --s-text: #fff;
    }
```

### Typography
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for all text on the website. `letter-spacing -2px` was used on titles to differentiate them from other text.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes
Wireframes were created using draw.io. Aditionally I created mockups of the website using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/OFxJJWxgwTg3WBurLY3zGF/Ping-Pong-Wireframe?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=plcfjeSpSSZlJuFL-1) which helped immensly with translating the design ideas to responsive CSS code.

*Note that the Figma mockups don't look exactly like the final product since I only used them for initial implementation of the code. They represent an earlier version of the site. For later design changes I adapted the wireframes made with draw.io above.*

## Features

### Existing Features

#### [Header with Logo and Navigation üîó](https://github.com/benschaf/tabletennis-vs-pingpong/blob/6a418b11362ddfb6daa11785b437b07b81038081/index.html#L24-L43)
The website has a header navigation bar that allows users to easily navigate to different sections of the site. The last item of the navigation bar serves as a cta (call to action) for the user to subscribe to the [newsletter](#signup-section).

![screenshot-header](/documentation/images/screenshots/screenshot-header.png)

#### [Landing Page üîó](https://github.com/benschaf/tabletennis-vs-pingpong/blob/6a418b11362ddfb6daa11785b437b07b81038081/index.html)
The Landing page `index.html` gives the user an extensive overview over the topic. It starts with a hero section and a call to action at the top. After that the user discovers information in bite sized sections by scrolling further down. All sections of the Landing page are presented below.

![screencast-landing-page](/documentation/images/screenshots/screnncast-landing-page.gif)

#### [Hero Section üîó](https://github.com/benschaf/tabletennis-vs-pingpong/blob/6a418b11362ddfb6daa11785b437b07b81038081/index.html#L47-L62)
The website has a hero section with an image and text that introduces the site and its purpose.
The hero section also includes a visible call to action button which links to the [Signup Section](#signup-section).

![screenshot-hero](/documentation/images/screenshots/screenshot-hero.png)

#### [Differences Section üîó](https://github.com/benschaf/tabletennis-vs-pingpong/blob/6a418b11362ddfb6daa11785b437b07b81038081/index.html#L63-L102)
The Differences section lays out initial information about the differences between Table Tennis and Ping Pong. It also describes what the term 'Clickball' means.
This section is accompanied by an image to generate some interest in this part of the page.

![screenshot-differences](/documentation/images/screenshots/screenshot-differences.png)

#### [Timeline Section üîó](https://github.com/benschaf/tabletennis-vs-pingpong/blob/6a418b11362ddfb6daa11785b437b07b81038081/index.html#L103-L201)
The website has a timeline section that displays important events in a chronological order. The timeline is designed in a visually interesting and intuitive way by displaying a vertical timeline next to visually separated events.

![screenshot-timeline](/documentation/images/screenshots/screenshot-timeline.png)

#### [Quotes Section üîó](https://github.com/benschaf/tabletennis-vs-pingpong/blob/6a418b11362ddfb6daa11785b437b07b81038081/index.html#L202-L248)
The website has a quotes section that displays quotes from users. The quotes are only static at this stage of development which means that they are directly coded into the `index.html` file.

![screenshot-quotes](/documentation/images/screenshots/screenshot-quotes.png)

#### [Signup Section üîó](https://github.com/benschaf/tabletennis-vs-pingpong/blob/6a418b11362ddfb6daa11785b437b07b81038081/index.html#L249-L267)
The website has a signup form that allows users to subscribe to a newsletter or other updates. The only function of the signup form at this stage is that it links to the `subscribed.html` page. The email entered into the form isn't stored anywhere.
This also means that the user won't receive any newsletter updates via email contrary to what is suggested on the website.

The limited functionality of the signup form is implemented as follows:

``` html
    <form id="signup-form" action="subscribed.html">
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="your@email.here" required>
        <input type="submit" value="Sign up now">
    </form>
```

The `method` attribute of the `form` tag was omitted. This basically turns the submit button into an anchor to the `action` attribute content - in this case a link to `subscribed.html`

![screenshot-signup](/documentation/images/screenshots/screenshot-signup.png)

#### [Signup Successful Section üîó](https://github.com/benschaf/tabletennis-vs-pingpong/blob/6a418b11362ddfb6daa11785b437b07b81038081/subscribed.html)
Once the user inserts an email and submits the form, they are redirected to the `subscribed.html` page. There they receive a quick message that they have successfully subscribed. After 10 seconds the website redirects the user automatically back to the Signup Section.

The automatic redirect is acheived using the following code on line 21 in `subscribed.html`:

`<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="10; url=index.html#signup-section">`

![screenshot-signedup](/documentation/images/screenshots/screenshot-signedup.png)

#### [Gallery Page üîó](https://github.com/benschaf/tabletennis-vs-pingpong/blob/6a418b11362ddfb6daa11785b437b07b81038081/gallery.html)
The Gallery Page displays a couple of pictures on the topic of Table Tennis vs. Ping Pong. The user can spend some time here gathering impressions.
The Gallery was styled using a responsive vertical masonry style pattern. The code for the gallery is heavily adapted from [w3bits.com](https://w3bits.com/flexbox-masonry/).

The vertical masonry is acheived using flexbox.
``` css
    .masonry-gallery {
        flex-wrap: wrap;
        max-height: 2190px;
        /* Adjustment for the gutter */
        margin-left: -8px;
    }

    .masonry-brick {
        /* Some gutter */
        margin: 0 8px 8px 0;
        /* allow for 2 columns */
        width: 50%;
    }

    .masonry-brick>img {
        width: 100%;
        object-fit: cover;
        border-radius: 12px;
    }
```

![screencast-gallery](/documentation/images/screenshots/screencast-gallery.gif)

#### [Footer üîó](https://github.com/benschaf/tabletennis-vs-pingpong/blob/6a418b11362ddfb6daa11785b437b07b81038081/index.html#L269-L295)
The website has a footer that includes social media links and other relevant information.

![screenshot-footer](/documentation/images/screenshots/screenshot-footer.png)

#### Responsive Design
The website is designed to be responsive and can adapt to different screen sizes, making it easy to use on mobile devices.

##### Pop-up menu and signup form on mobile
The navigation menu and the signup form are not visible at first on smaller screens. They pop-up, after clicking on a corresponding button. This functionality is achieved using only css. The visibility of the popup changes from `display: none;` to `display: box` and `display: flex;` respectively. This code was adapted from the [love running project by code institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-v3/tree/main/3.5b-toggling-a-dropdown-menu). Below is the html and css for the signup form popup functionality:

``` html
    <input type="checkbox" id="signup-toggle" name="signup-toggle">
    <label for="signup-toggle" aria-label="Open Signup input Field">
        <span class="hero-button newsletter-button">Get our Newsletter</span>
    </label>
    <form id="signup-form" action="subscribed.html"> 
        <!-- Form content --> 
    </form>
```

``` css
    /* Signup toggle */
    #signup-toggle:checked~#signup-form {
        display: flex;
    }

    #signup-toggle {
        display: none;
    }
```

![screencast-signup-toggle](/documentation/images/screenshots/screencast-signup-toggle.gif)

![screencast-nav-toggle](/documentation/images/screenshots/screencast-nav-toggle.gif)

##### Animated Quotes Section on mobile
To reduce scrolling and to make the website a bit more interesting the quotes section is animated when viewed on mobile screens. By clicking on one of the buttons below the quote, a corresponding quote slides into view.

The code for this feature is adapted from a project on codepen.io by [maheshambure21](https://codepen.io/maheshambure21/pen/qZZrxy?editors=1100).

The functionality is acheived using radio buttons and an animation:
``` css
    .slider__nav:checked {
        animation: check 0.4s linear forwards;
    }

    /* different position depending on which radio button is checked */
    .slider__nav:checked:nth-of-type(1)~.slider__inner {
        left: 0%;
    }

    .slider__nav:checked:nth-of-type(2)~.slider__inner {
        left: -100%;
    }

    .slider__nav:checked:nth-of-type(3)~.slider__inner {
        left: -200%;
    }

    .slider__nav:checked:nth-of-type(4)~.slider__inner {
        left: -300%;
    }

    .slider__inner {
        /* other code */
        transition: left 0.4s;
    }

    /* animation for feedback when checking radio buttons */
    @keyframes check {
        50% {
            outline-color: #6a6a80;
            box-shadow: 0 0 0 12px #6a6a80, 0 0 0 36px rgba(51, 51, 51, 0.2);
        }

        100% {
            outline-color: #6a6a80;
            box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 #6a6a80, 0 0 0 0 rgba(51, 51, 51, 0);
        }
    }
```

![screencast-quotes-slider](/documentation/images/screenshots/screencast-quotes-slider.gif)

##### Max Width and Background Colour
The website restricts the width of the main section to 1600px for readability and centers it if it gets too large.
The website has a background color of `#f3f3f3`.

## Future Feature suggestions

- **Improved Subscription Feature**: I think it would be great to add more functionality to the subscription feature. For example, I could allow users to choose the frequency of updates they receive or provide exclusive content to subscribers.

- **Social Media Integration**: I already have social media links in my footer. I could add more social media integration to my website, such as allowing users to share content from my website directly to their social media accounts.

- **Training Videos**: I could add a section to my website that includes training videos created by professional Table Tennis players. This would be a great resource for Table Tennis enthusiasts who want to improve their skills and technique.

- **Discussion Forum**: I would like to add a discussion forum to my website that allows users to create posts, reply to posts, and interact with other users. This would be a great way for Table Tennis players to connect with each other and share tips and advice.

- **Live Streaming**: I think it would be great to add a live streaming feature that allows users to watch Table Tennis and Ping Pong matches in real-time. This feature could also include a chat function that allows users to interact with each other while watching the matches.

### Version Control (Regrets and improvements)
Since this is my first project using version control, the first half of the commit messages aren't written very carefully. Quite often the title of messages goes over the 50 character limit and the imperative mode isn't always used. I was already too far into the project when I found out that commit messages cannot be edited after pushing them to github.

After consultation about this with my mentor, I made sure to study Chris Beams's 
[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) and adhere to the principles layed out in that document.

Later on in the project I switched my Issue Tracking from Notion (using a Kanban Board) to Github Issues and further adapted commit messages that were relevant to certain issues with the issue id. For example: "feat: add awesome feature closes #123".

### Acknowledgements
- I would like to thank my Code Institute mentor, [Tim Nelson](https://github.com/TravelTimN) for his support throughout the development of this project.
- I would like to thank the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) tutor team for their assistance with troubleshooting and debugging some project issues.
- I would like to thank the [Code Institute Slack community](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/) for the moral support; it kept me going during periods of self doubt and imposter syndrome.
- I would like to thank my wife Maria, for believing in me, and allowing me to make this transition into software development.
