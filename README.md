## UX
The design process was separated into XXXX phases:
1. **Collecting inspiration:** Design ideas for the project were taken from the following two websites: store.google.com and youtube.com. The resulting design for this website is kept clean and simple.
2. **Creating User Stories, Wireframes and Mockups:** These were prepared in order to create a better vision of the final project. These drafts were then tailored to provide a relevant and meaningufl exprecience to the user.
3. **Collecting feedback early on:** My Mentor and the great Community of Code Institute were essential in ironing out UX considerations that I hadn't considered. For Acknowledgements see the [title further down](###Acknowledgements).
