## UX
The design process was separated into XXXX phases:
1. **Collecting inspiration:** Design ideas for the project were taken from the following two websites: store.google.com and youtube.com. The resulting design for this website is kept clean and simple.
2. **Creating User Stories, Wireframes and Mockups:** These were prepared in order to create a better vision of the final project. These drafts were then tailored to provide a relevant and meaningufl exprecience to the user.
3. **Collecting feedback early on:** My Mentor and the great Community of Code Institute were essential in ironing out UX considerations that I hadn't considered. For Acknowledgements see the [title further down](###Acknowledgements).

### Colour Scheme
The Colour Scheme for this Project was extracted from it's [hero image](#tabletennis-vs-pingpong). The blue tones work nicely together with most Table Tennis related Pictures because of the blue color of official Table Tennis tables.

- `#2B2B34` used for darker backgrounds.
- `#F3F3F3` used for text bubbles
- `#151536` used for the footer.
- `#000000` used for primary text.
- `#55C2DA` used for primary highlights.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/2b2b34-f3f3f3-151526-000000-55c2da) to generate my colour palette.
