# [TABLETENNIS VS PINGPONG](https://benschaf.github.io/tabletennis-vs-pingpong)

Have you ever finally wanted to settle the difference in meaning of “Table Tennis” and “Ping Pong”? Have you never heard of the sport “Clickball” before? Then this website is perfect for you!

![iamresponsive mockup image](documentation/images/mockup.png)

This repository provides an engaging and informative platform that explores the history, differences, and fun facts about the terms Ping Pong, Table Tennis and Clickball. It includes five sections, covering the general differences of Ping Pong and Table Tennis, a visual representation of the key events and milestones in the history of Ping Pong and Table Tennis, an interesting collection of quotes on the topic, a subscription-based service that provides users with regular updates and insights about the world of Ping Pong and Table Tennis (Disclaimer: The subscription feature is still in development) and a media gallery.

## UX
The design process was separated into XXXX phases:
1. **Collecting inspiration:** Design ideas for the project were taken from the following two websites: store.google.com and youtube.com. The resulting design for this website is kept clean and simple.
2. **Creating User Stories, Wireframes and Mockups:** These were prepared in order to create a better vision of the final project. These drafts were then tailored to provide a relevant and meaningufl exprecience to the user.
3. **Collecting feedback early on:** My Mentor and the great Community of Code Institute were essential in ironing out UX considerations that I hadn't considered. For Acknowledgements see ["Acknowledgements"](###Acknowledgements).

UX research practices werent in the scope of this project.

### Colour Scheme
The Colour Scheme for this Project was extracted from it's [hero image](#tabletennis-vs-pingpong). The blue tones work nicely together with most Table Tennis related Pictures because of the blue color of official Table Tennis tables.

- `#2B2B34` used for darker backgrounds.
- `#F3F3F3` used for text bubbles
- `#151536` used for the footer.
- `#000000` used for primary text.
- `#55C2DA` used for primary highlights.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/2b2b34-f3f3f3-151526-000000-55c2da) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for all text on the website. `letter-spacing -2px` was used on titles to differentiate them from other text.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.
