                                Ping pong is a casual game that is often played in homes and recreational centers. It is
                                played on a smaller table, and the paddles are usually made of wood. There is a sport
                                called <span class="highlight-text">Clickball</span>, but it is not very popular yet.

                            held in 1902. In those early days, the scoring system was the same as in lawn tennis.
